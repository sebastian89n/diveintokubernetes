# Dive Into Kubernetes - Getting Started with Containers, Docker and Kubernetes - Docker Desktop Extension - Tutorial

This tutorial supports you in running a Kubernetes lab, accessible in Docker Desktop ðŸš€

**Update**: Starting with Docker Desktop **version 1.31 and later**, you will need to make a change in the settings to use extensions that are not distributed through the Docker Marketplace:

1. Go to **Settings**.
2. Navigate to **Extensions**.
3. Untoggle the option labeled **'Allow only extensions distributed through the Docker Marketplace'**.

This will allow you to use extensions from sources other than the Docker Marketplace.

The easiest way of installing the lab is by accessing the following url, it should automatically open in Docker Desktop - [Open in Docker Desktop](https://open.docker.com/extensions/marketplace?extensionId=spurin/diveintokubernetes-introduction-lab-extension&tag=latest)

Alternatively, the lab can be installed using the command line by executing -

```
docker extension install spurin/diveintokubernetes-introduction-lab-extension
```
